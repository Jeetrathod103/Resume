        <h3>Programming, Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I began learning to code when I was 16 years old because of my board exams.
          Later, I developed an interest in coding and decided to pursue a career in computer science.
          As of now, I've gained a substantial amount of experience in a variety of programming languages,
          as well as in the design and development of websites.</p>

        <img class="Research-picture" src="images/Research.png" alt="Research & Management Picture">
        <h3>Research and Management</h3>
        <p>Since I am a person who values information, research is an integral part of my life.
          I've even worked in a tech startup as a Research and Development Executive.
          I've even worked in my college's cultural festival as a management executive.
          I've also worked as an artist and guest management executive in a Social Event called Social Conclave.</p>
